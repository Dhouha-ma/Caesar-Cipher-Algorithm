# Caesar-Cipher-Algorithm

The funtion will take two parameters, a string and a number. 
The objective is to shift every letter in the str by the num. 
Example: zoo keeper => bqq mggrgt 
The algorithm should be able to handle negative numbers => be able to shift the str backward as well if the num is negative.
